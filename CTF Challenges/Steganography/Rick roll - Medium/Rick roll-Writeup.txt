The video only displays black and white pixels. Files consist of bits that are represented by 0/1 or on/off. This encoding also works with black and white squares, which could be used to store data in video form. Now you could write a script to get the data back from the video; fortunately, some useful scripts are already on GitHub. A possible solution is the Infinite Storage Glitch created by DvorakDwarf.
