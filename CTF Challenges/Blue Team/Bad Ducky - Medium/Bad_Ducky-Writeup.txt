#### Bad Ducky - Easy

*You found a USB stick on the floor, of course you plug it into your private computer. What was the previous owner up to?*

To solve the problem, we received a black USB stick with no external peculiarities. After plugging it into a computer, the USB stick mounts with the meaningless name "Generic Flash Disk USB Drive". There is a file in which the BSI describes the correct handling of removable storage devices. No further data can be found even after activating hidden files in the Windows Explorer. After a few attempts to examine the file, it turns out it is a dead end and does not contain the flag. However, one passage from the directive is interesting.
