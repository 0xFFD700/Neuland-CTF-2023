*Open a lock with an instrument other than the proper key.
Pick up a lock, pick, and tension wrench at the front and bring back the opened lock to the CTF orga to get the flag.*

The objective is simple; the lock must be opened using the included pick and tension wrench. A good resource for beginners is the [MIT Lockpicking Guide](https://blog.ssdev.org/lockpicking/MIT_D/MIT-Handbuch.pdf).

The flag is ```nland{T3D_Th3_TooL}```
