An LED-illuminated Christmas tree is provided to solve the task, which regularly changes its colors. After looking at it for a while, the following features become apparent:
- 6 different colors (green, yellow, blue, light blue, pink, red)
- The 6th color is displayed longer
- After 18 colors, the Christmas tree shuts down and starts again from the beginning

With this information, we can create the following pattern:

|   |   |    |   |    |   | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| green | yellow | yellow | blue | red | green |
| red | blue | light blue| pink | yellow | blue |
| light blue | pink | green | red | pink | light blue |

A quick Google search shows that only a few cryptographic algorithms use colors as a form of representation. One of them is Hexahue, which uses the same colors.

Enter the color combination into an [online decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/hexahue-cipher) and get the word hoe.
