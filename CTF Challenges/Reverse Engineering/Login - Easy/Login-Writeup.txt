We get a portable executable with the MD5 hash ***A97F6CA98E275F846150A4E1EC45FBD0***. A closer look in a PE editor and process viewer like [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388) tells us the file is probably not packed or compressed. Strings can be identified, and in the ***IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER*** the raw data size roughly corresponds to the virtual data size. This should enable us to read the strings used in the program code without using a software reverse engineering framework like [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). We can search for the string ***nland{*** in the Ascii representation under the Hex Editor tab to find the rest of the flag.
